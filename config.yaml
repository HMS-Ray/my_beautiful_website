    subtitle: "I would like to use this website to write down something I have been lusted to express.
      \n It's a wonderful opportunity to let me clear up my mind and also let you know me better. \n    
      All of words and analysis come from my own understanding so they're childish for sure. \n    
      These are some of topics that I'm interested in. Hope I will have more in the future.
      Time is a flat circle.\n May you have a good day and a good life."
